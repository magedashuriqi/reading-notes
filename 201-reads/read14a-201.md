## *Transforms*
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. 
- the word rotate can rotate the shapes horizentally or vertically.
- 2D scale: allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.
- 2D translate: allow you to move the items and change there positions.
- 2D skew: to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.

## *Transitions & Animations*
the element here must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
